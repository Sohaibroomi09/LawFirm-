        <br><h3 style="padding:10px;">An Insight: into The Banking Sector of Pakistan:</h3>
		<p style="padding:10px;">An Insight: into The Banking Sector of Pakistan:
Banks and financial institutions being financial intermediaries have gone through an evolutionary time period over a couple of decades. Especially in Pakistan, this evolution has had its peak in the last decade where the banks and financial institutions have been successful in spreading out their money into the market in the form of loans, leases and other ancillary financial services. This led them to being deprived of their own money which had become hard to recover from the debtors even after adopting many procedures and taking different measures. These millions and even billions of rupees affected the banking services enormously and hence put a full stop to deliberate increase in banking capital, alternating their ways toward recoveries.</p>

<h3 style="padding:10px;">Litigation Modality of Banks:</h3>
<p style="padding:10px;">Generally Banks employ two methods for litigation purposes:
The services of in-house permanent legal department, and/or Banks Out source litigation to lawyers or firms
The former is subject to monthly salaries while the latter to case-to-case based fees.

In either of the case, lawyers prefer to institute a Recovery Suit, which ultimately becomes the part of courts’ procedural culture. By that time lawyers themselves and Banks involved lose interest in recovery; its fate becomes a dream to be realized after an infinite span of time as it has to be decreed and executed or auctioned afterwards.</p>

<h3 style="padding:10px;">Weak Link In Banking Litigation:</h3>
<p style="padding:10px;">For lodging application for an FIR, the Bank has to manage this through its legal department which by itself is not experienced enough to deal with the POLICE, FIA and NAB etc. Likewise for mediation and conciliation for Settlements with the defaulter, the Bank does not have the required expertise. The desired result is not achieved in a reasonable time frame because different teams are working in different domains and at multiple levels.</p>

<h3 style="padding:10px;">How We are Different?</h3>
<p style="padding:10px;">Our Approach & Objectives:
